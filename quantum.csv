Using noisy, intermediate scale quantum computers as platforms for testing and evaluating, we prototype applications in chemistry and materials science to evaluate the accuracy and computational complexity underlying such approaches. We explore the trade-space of algorithm design and platform constraints to define metrics that offer insights into when quantum computers may be ready for performance-driven applications and what must be overcome to reach this capability.

This paper proposes hybrid models and methods that effectively leverage the complementary strengths of deterministic algorithms and QC techniques to overcome combinatorial complexity for solving large-scale mixed-integer programming problems. Four applications, namely the molecular conformation problem, job-shop scheduling problem, manufacturing cell formation problem, and the vehicle routing problem, are specifically addressed. Large-scale instances of these application problems across multiple scales ranging from molecular design to logistics optimization are computationally challenging for deterministic optimization algorithms on classical computers. To address the computational challenges, hybrid QC-based algorithms are proposed and extensive computational experimental results are presented to demonstrate their applicability and efficiency.

Our results are generally consistent with theoretical predictions of Elsässer et al. [Mat. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. 453 221–226 (1997)]. They argued that the effective Born-Oppenheimer potential experienced by the hydrogen atoms in ε-ZrH2 is nearly isotropic and harmonic at energies below 0.3 eV, but becomes anisotropic and anharmonic for higher energies. At low temperatures, the proton momentum distribution is dominated by the quantum-mechanical ground state of the protons. We find that it assumes a Gaussian shape, consistent with the concept that the potential surface is approximately harmonic for small displacements of the hydrogen atoms.

Newly synthesized crystalline barlowite (Cu4(OH)6FBr) and Zn-substituted barlowite demonstrate the delicate interplay between singlet states and spin order on the spin-1/2 kagome lattice. Comprehensive structural measurements demonstrate that our new variant of barlowite maintains hexagonal symmetry at low temperatures with an arrangement of distorted and undistorted kagome triangles, for which numerical simulations predict a pinwheel valence bond crystal (VBC) state instead of a QSL. The presence of interlayer spins eventually leads to an interesting pinwheel q = 0 magnetic order. Partially Zn-substituted barlowite (Cu3.44Zn0.56(OH)6FBr) has an ideal kagome lattice and shows QSL behavior, indicating a surprising robustness of the QSL against interlayer impurities. The magnetic susceptibility is similar to that of herbertsmithite, even though the Cu2+ impurities are above the percolation threshold for the interlayer lattice and they couple more strongly to the nearest kagome moment.

We further parameterize this benchmark suite on the trial circuit type, the level of symmetry reduction, and error mitigation strategies. Our results demonstrate the characteristically high noise level present in near-term superconducting hardware, but provide a relevant baseline for future improvement of the underlying hardware, and a means for comparison across near-term hardware types. We also demonstrate how to reduce the noise in post processing with specific error mitigation techniques.

With regard to the increasing heterogeneity of modern computing machines, DCA++ provides portable performance on conventional and emerging new architectures, such as hybrid CPU–GPU, sustaining multiple petaflops on ORNL’s Titan and CSCS’ Piz Daint supercomputers. Moreover, we show how sustainable and scalable development of the code base has been achieved by adopting standard techniques of the software industry. These include employing a distributed version control system, applying test-driven development and following continuous integration.",10.1016/j.cpc.2019.01.006,,,29-Aug-20,1-Apr-19,Full,"3NMSD200, 3395CF01, 3395CF02, 3NMSD201",2019,2019,1,2020,,,,,,,,,,19,50008679,Computational Chemical & Matls Sciences,,1651409,Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility,Not applicable,"KC0202031, KJ0403010, KJ0403010, KC0202031","ERKCZ45, ERKJ329, ERKJ329, ERKCZ45",,Basic Energy Sciences (BES),,25-Aug-20,2020,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,"Urs Hähner, Gonzalo Alvarez, Thomas Maier, Raffaele Solca, Peter Staar, Michael Summers, Thomas Schulthess",Link to: Pub Id 124714
122157,Quantum material topology via defect engineering,Completed,Journal,,,Physical Review B,"Unclassified, Non Sensitive",Panchapakesan Ganesh,2020,2019,100,24,241110(R),,"Current approaches of discovering new topological quantum materials, such as (magnetic) Weyl materials, by screening material databases or by rational design suffer from experimental challenges in growing the material in the desired geometry, hampering their potential applications. We take an approach of defect-engineering a topology starting from systems with experimentally well-controlled growth. Using SnTe, an experimentally viable topological crystalline insulator, as our model system, we elucidate the different effects of breaking time-reversal, inversion, and mirror symmetries using magnetic dopant defects, to controllably induce a topological phase transition. To this effect, we compute the thermodynamics, magnetism, and band-structure topology of magnetically doped SnTe using a full ab initio approach. In this process, we have discovered that Cr-doped SnTe is a Weyl semimetal. We have computed its classic Fermi-arc experimental signature on the (001) surface and also showed that it has a large anamolous Hall conductivity (AHC) of ∼250 Ω−1cm−1. We predict a large Curie temperature (Tc) of 62 K even at 3.3% doping, with both Tc and AHC being tunable with Cr concentration, suggesting potential for room-temperature applications. Our study in general paves the way for defect-designing room-temperature topological quantum phases.",10.1103/PhysRevB.100.241110,,,30-May-20,16-Jan-19,Full,3L118150,2019,2019,12,2019,,,,,,,,,,6,50232375,Center for Nanophase Matls Sciences,,1631260,"Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences, Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility",Not applicable,,,,Not Applicable,,27-May-20,2020,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"Anh Pham, Panchapakesan Ganesh",Link to: Pub Id 122157
